These zines are by me ([Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca)).

### what's a zine?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzine):

<blockquote class="ml-4 pl-2 border-l-4 border-orange-light mb-2">
A fanzine (blend of fan and magazine or -zine) is a non-professional and non-official publication produced by enthusiasts of a particular cultural phenomenon (such as a literary or musical genre) for the pleasure of others who share their interest. 
</blockquote>

The zines on this site are usually about 20 pages, and they're full of short,
informative, and fun comics which will quickly teach you something useful.

A lot of them are focused on systems/Linux concepts.

### who are these zines for?

They're aimed at working programmers, like me! The idea is that you're busy,
you want to know how to use grep / tcpdump / strace, and the man page makes
your head hurt.

Occasionally folks tell me ("my daughter read your zine and knows all about
tcpdump now!"), but that's not the main audience. If your kids love them,
awesome!

### how to read them

The easiest way to read any of these is on your computer.

But the **best** way to read them is to print it out, staple it, fold it,
read it, and then give it to a friend. It turns out it's way easier to
convince your friends to read a physical thing that is in front of them.

They all have black & white version to make sure they print well if you only have a black & white
printer.
