Ever wanted to know how to use tcpdump, but were intimidated by all the command line options? I was too! But then I learned it, and it wasn’t as bad as I thought. In this zine we’ll explain:

* what kinds of questions you can answer with tcpdump
* how to interpret tcpdump output
* which command line arguments are the really important ones
* how to write a BPF filter to filter tcpdump output

There’s a [Russian translation](https://m.habrahabr.ru/company/first/blog/335428/%5Bperevod%5D-podborka-slaydov-ot-dzhulii-eva/).
