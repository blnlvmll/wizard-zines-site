If you find git confusing, don't worry! You're not alone.

People who've been using it every day for years still make mistakes and aren't sure how to fix them. A lot of git commands are confusingly named (why do you create new branches with git checkout?) and there are 20 million different ways to do everything.

This zine explains git fundamentals (what's a SHA?) and how to fix a lot of common git mistakes (I committed to the wrong branch!!).
