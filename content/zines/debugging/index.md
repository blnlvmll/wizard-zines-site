This is a zine about some of my favorite Linux debugging tools, especially tools that I don’t think
are as well-known as they should be. It covers strace, opensnoop/eBPF, and dstat! netcat, netstat,
tcpdump, wireshark, and ngrep! And there’s a whole section on perf because perf is the best.

If you don’t know what any of those tools I just mentioned are – PERFECT. You are who this zine is
for!!! Read it and find out why I love them! Also, a lot of these tools happen to work on OS X :)
