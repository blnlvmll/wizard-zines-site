Are you confused by CORS? Have you seen GET and POST requests but aren't sure how they work exactly? Not sure what HTTP/2 is or what changes you're going to have to make to your website to support it?

HTTP is the protocol that the browser uses when it visits every website, and this zine explains how it works. This zine's goal is to help you understand HTTP requests and responses, so that when something goes wrong you can debug it by looking at your HTTP requests, checking the documentation, and fixing the problem instead of changing random things and guessing.
