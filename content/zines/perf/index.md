Want to get better at profiling & tracing your programs on Linux? perf is a
super useful tool, but it’s fairly complicated and I found it hard to get
started with. Over the last 4 years, I’ve learned a lot about how perf works,
and I’ve compressed what I know into this zine for you!

You’ll learn how you can use perf to profile programs in many different
programming languages (C, node.js, Java, Rust, and more!), how to count any
kernel event you’re interested in (syscalls! network packets sent!), how to
analyze the data that perf gives you, and more!
