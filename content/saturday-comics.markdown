Love the comics you see posted [on twitter](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/981159808832286720)? Want more? 
Sign up for the Saturday comics list and I'll send you one of my favourite comics from the wizard zines
archives every Saturday. I'll also email you (much more rarely) when I release a new zine.

Here is what your inbox would look like:

<div align="center">

</div>

Here's the signup form:
