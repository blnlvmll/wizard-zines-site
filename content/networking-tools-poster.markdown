title: "Every Linux networking tool I know"
path: /networking-tools-poster/

Do you ever feel like there are like 50 different linux networking tools that all do different
things and it's impossible to keep track? That's because there are about 10 billion linux networking tools.
This isn't even including web/dns servers like apache / nginx / unbound, just regular command line
tools!  So I made this fun poster with a super short description of each one, in the hopes that
it'll help you keep track and maybe find some new tools to learn about.

You can <a href="/networking-tools-poster.pdf">download a PDF of this poster and print it</a> if you
want a reminder :). And if you want more, I'm working on a zine (Bite Size Networking!!) which
has comics <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1094652472340242432">like this</a> explaining
the 20 of these tools that I think are the most important.
