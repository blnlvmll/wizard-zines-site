The "print version" of all of these zines is formatted so that when you print it on your printer, it
will fold correctly. You'll need to:

1. make sure it's set to "landscape"
1. print double sided
1. choose "long edge" (not "short edge").

Here's what the print dialog should look like.

Folks sometimes have problems printing from Chrome. I'd recommend printing from
your PDF reader instead if you run into issues.
